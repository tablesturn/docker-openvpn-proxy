This workarounds did apply to me when using a Raspberry Pi 4 running Debian buster (aarch64):

Because my VPN server did not support IPv6, the tunneling did only work for IPv4 and not IPv6.
In my case, I don't need IPv6 right now, so the solution was to disable it using a the /etc/modprobe.d/ipv6.conf configuration file:

alias net-pf-10 off
alias ipv6 off
options ipv6 disable_ipv6=1
blacklist ipv6

Optionally and if required, add in /boot/cmdtline.txt the parameter:

ipv6.disable=1

Also, docker was altering my custom iptables firewall (even when --iptables=false). It seems to be a common problem.
Workaround: Run the firewall script again manually after every boot (after the dockerd started).
Iptables-persistent and other solutions seem to change the firewall settings before docker starts.
